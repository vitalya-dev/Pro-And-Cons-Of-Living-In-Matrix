---Ben-BASIC Help---

This is a quick-start tutorial for how to use Ben-BASIC

First, run Interpret.py using your python interpreter. You will get a prompt such as the one below:

1) Command Line
2) Run File
enter choice: 

If you type "1" and hit enter, you will be sent into the command line which will something like this:

>>> 

Here, you can type commands such as 'print "hello world!"', and the Interpreter will run them.

There are also a couple of special abilities exclusive to the command line.

1. In the command line, not only can you run single lines, but you can also run programs composed of multiple lines.
Simply begin your input with the line number you wish to edit, and then type your line. For instance, if I typed:

>>> 1 input name, "enter your name: "
>>> 2 print "hello "+name

Then I would have made a program that asks a user for their name and then says hello to them.

2. Special Commands of the Command Line include the following:

-"end" :
If you type "end" (no spaces, just those characters), then you will exit the command line.

-"delete" :
This command deletes the program you have entered into the command line.

-"list arg1, arg2"
This command lists a section of your program. arg1 and arg2 are optional. arg1 is the line to start at, and arg2 is the line to end at.

-"insert arg1, arg2"
This command inserts a line of code corresponding to what was entered as arg2 at line arg1, incrementing all other lines below it.


And that's it for the quick-start tutorial!
