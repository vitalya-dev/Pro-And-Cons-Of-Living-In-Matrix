This archive contains ex/vi 3.7 of 6/7/85, its manual pages, and the
termcap library, originally from the 2.11BSD distribution. All of them
were to some extent changed by me to support newer POSIX compatible
Unix systems.

A larger addition is the ability to handle 8 bit character sets. It
is enabled by default, although it may produce subtle changes in ex's
behaviour I did not discover yet.

Some changes were made to get closer to the POSIX.2 guidelines for
ex and vi.

Adjustable values for compilation can be found in the files Makefile and
config.h.

The following systems are known to compile this code:

Linux		2.2, 2.4; glibc 2.2, 2.1, libc4; diet libc; uClib
FreeBSD		3.1, 4.5
Solaris		9; 8; 2.6, 2.5.1
Open UNIX	8.0.0
UnixWare	7.1.1, 7.0.1, 2.1.2
AIX		5.1, 4.3
HP-UX		B.11.11, B.11.00, B.10.20

Compilation reports from other systems are highly welcome, whether
successful or not (in the latter case add a detailed description).
