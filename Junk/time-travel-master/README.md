# TIME TRAVEL 

I know it sound fake but it works ! So you got your dirty hands on this but this dosent mean it will always work :smiling_imp: . HAHAHA!! But if it works you should I emphasis at ***should*** bring you back in one piece . I am not responsible if your torso dosent come with you . You might have symptoms of smelling choco fudge where nothing is actually there . But there is a good side , you can time travel to the futere and tell us if we (in 2021 or 2022) found anything such as COVAX or Covid Vaccine . I am saying that because i havent tested it , but it should 90%  work. 

## Requirements 
All you need is python and a PC . 
Run code by 
```
cd /d "folder"
