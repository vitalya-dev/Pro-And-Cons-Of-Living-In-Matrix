0.5.0	Half way there!  Implemented write out, save function seems
	stable.  Changed statusbar blank routing to not refresh, a separte
	program calls it and then refreshes.  Made the program not clear
	the srceen on exit, just the bottom two lines (like Pico).
0.4.2	Implemented replace all in replace function.  Crude exit function
	(asks yes or no if modified but does not write to file).
0.4.1	Implementing search & replace.  Fixed crash on deleting at top of
	edit buffer.  Implemented "timeout" of statusbar messages.
	Implemented ^A and ^E (beginning and end of line).
0.4.0	Split code into global.c and proto.h to allow for better multiple
	file handling.  Added #defines for the majority of the shortcut
	kets in tip.h for easy modification. 
0.3.1	Write edit_refresh which doesn't move the screen around, just
	updates what's there already.  do_wrap() and do_enter() added.
0.3.0	Preliminary cutbuffer (cut and uncut) support.
0.2.7   Check for Modification added.  do_search() works.
0.2.5	Rewrite of file data struct.
0.2	Read in data to buffer, bound keystrokes to stub functions, 
	initial cursor movement on screen.  Initial autoconf support.
0.1	Initial program setup w/ncurses
