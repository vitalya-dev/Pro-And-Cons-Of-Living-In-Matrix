============================================================================


General:
========
High Priority:
  + enhancements:
    - don't like much how recursive chmod/chown/chgrp currently works
      . split in 2 different features chmod and chown/chgrp ?
    - support for languages with wide chars
      . look at Xin Wang's patch
      . check the real length on screen of the utf8-encoded strings.
        http://bugs.python.org/issue6755
        http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2476953/python-utf-8-howto-align-printout
  + documentation:
    - be sure version and release date is correct in all files

Medium Priority:
  + enhancements:
    - substitute curses.color_pair(X) for COL_XXX
  + ui:
    - tab views:
      . 2 columns mode
      . customized: permissions instead of date
      . quick view
      . info view
  + new features:
    - pyview:
      . use mmap
      . tail mode: option -f, document
    - powercli: |: run as tail -f, substitute run sync by default, document
    - diff and sync dirs: use filecmp.dircmp or rsync

Low Priority (maybe some day):
  + enhancements:
    - more than 10 bookmarks => use letters
    - find/grep
      . exclude files (f.e. *.o) in findgrep
        grep --exclude=XXX => NON-POSIX, GNU extension
      . checkboxes for ignorecase and regex flags
  + new features:
    - filter files (f.e. "*py" to only view python files)
    - crypt files => gnupg ?
    - new vfs: .rpm, .cpio, .deb, .jar, .xpi, .egg
    - show directory under cursor in the other panel: mc: Alt+O
    - keybindings customization
    - global copy/cut/paste between tabs or panes
    - background processes: copy/move/delete
  + other:
    - use mimetypes module
    - use pyinotify module
    - plugin system

Very Low Priority (never):
  + remote vfs: ssh, ftp, smb, webdav => read FAQ entry about fuse integration
  + advanced file rename tool => use PowerCLI
  + i18n => curses ui programming is very hard when dealing with different languages
            because strings have different lengths so it's imposible to design a nice
            and working interface for every language
  + mouse support
  + UI to configure preferences
  + "save delete" / delete moving to ~/.Trash


Known Bugs:
===========
+ general:
  - after renaming a file, cursor should be placed over the new file name,
    but this is not always posible because we don't know new file name
  - if an error happens while copying/moving/uncompressing/... =>
    => some rubbish remain in destination

+ compress.py:
  - rar with password halts lfm, because process is waiting for a password =>
    => timeout if not output and kill the spawned process
  - recursively chmod +w temp files before deleting

+ vfs.py:
  - .tar.gz inside a .tar.gz file (vfs in vfs)
  - tmpdir are showed in the copy/move/... dialogs or when view/edit/...
    a file, instead of vfs dir (this is just a minor estetic issue)
  - in case of 'panelize' vfs type (after find/grep), deleted / moved
    files are not deleted / moved in real path
